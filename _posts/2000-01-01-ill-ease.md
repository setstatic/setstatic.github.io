# Ill Ease

{% include images.html image=page.image image_count=page.image_count %}

There is a lot to cover here. So, to begin, just getting a post up as a bit of a placeholder. 
Ill Ease was, and possibly still is, the recording project of Elizabeth Sharp, known to most people as just Sharp.

Sharp was originally a member of the western Massachusetts band New Radiant Storm King. 
We met in Brooklyn sometime around 1998 and worked on a recording together for New Granada/Garuda.
At the time I believe she was playing in a band called Skinner Pilot. 
She also wrote and self recorded her first solo record around this time, Live at the Gate.

It's foggy when I first stated playing with Ill Ease. We toured together, I believe in 2000, 
playing songs from both Garuda and Ill Ease. I recall that we made it out to Detroit and back.

By 2002, I had become Sharp's bassist and touring with various linups of the band. 
We toured Europe multiple times between 2002 & 2004. Played at the WFMU record fair and made a guest apperance on the Scott Williams' show, which can be heard here: https://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/12575

Here is a favorite track from a 2002 recording session in England, <a href="/assets/audio/ill/macon.mp3">macon</a>

and, of course, the anthemic <a href="/assets/audio/ill/macon.mp3.mp3">backstabbers</a>.
